    [Verse 1]
    I fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
    And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
    I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
    And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?
    <br> 
    [Chorus]
    I know you're not in love like you used to be
    Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
    So you'll just run
    I know that I'm stuck in this misery
    Guess I’m not enough, like you used to think
    So I'll just run (Ooh)
    <br>
    [Verse 2]
    You bathe in your victory
    You blew out on my fuse
    And if I took on the planet
    Will I pay my dues?
    Your love was a mystery
    Yeah, my love is a fool
    And I traveled the country just to get to you
    <br> 
    [Chorus]
    I know you're not in love like you used to be
    Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
    So you'll just run
    I know that I'm stuck in this misery
    Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
    So I'll just run
    <br> 
    [Outro]
    And I traveled the country
    And I traveled the country just to get to you
    I know you’re not in love
    I know you’re not in love
    I know you're not in love
